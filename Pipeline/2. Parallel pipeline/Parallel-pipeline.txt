If we run three or job job in a pipeline it will take some time because they will execute
one after other but to save time we can run jobs in PARALLEL as well lets see how that works.

Step 1 : In earlier lab the order was Build-deploy-delivery in which delivery was manual.

Step 2 : Now we will add a Job named Project-3-parallel job.

Step 3 : Go to Project pipeline dashboard, now if you want to run this job paralle to deploy then
         go to Build --> Configure --> Post-build Actions --> Build other projects
         If you see one project is already added there which is deploy, add Project-3-parallel job.

Step 4 : Dashboard --> project-pipeline --> Run

         Once you run it you will see Project-3-deploy and Project-3-parallel job will run parallelly.
