There is two type of CD : Continuous Delivery
                          Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment : It works autometically.
                        Test --> Staging --> Production

Continuous Delivery   : It requires manual interventions.
                        Test --> Staging ---> Manual interventions --> Production



In this lab we will learn how to build a Continuous Deployment pipeline in Jenkins.


Step 1 : We will create 2 items eg. Project-3-build and Project-3-deploy

Step 2 : Install pulgin Build Pipeline.

Step 3 : Go to Project-3-build --> Configure --> Post-build actions
         --> Build other projects --> Apply/Save

Step 4 : Dashboard --> + (beside all) --> Name --> Build Pipeline View

Step 5 : Name --> Pipeline flow-Upstream/downstream --> Select Job --> Project-3-build

Step 6 : Run --> and you will see your both projects will first build then deploy one.

         This is how you will build your first pipeline successfully.



Now we will learn how Continuous Delivery works.

Step 7 : Add another item or job Project-3-delivery.

Step 8 : If you want to run this project after Project-3-deploy
         go to Project-3-deploy configure --> post-build Actions --> Build other projects(manual)
         --> Add Project-3-delivery --> Apply/Save.

Step 9 : Now run your pipeline you will see your oth job will run autometically and third one 
         will not untill you manually triggers it by pressing the trigger button on the job.
